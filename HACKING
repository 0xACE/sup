Running Sup locally
-------------------
Invoke it like this:

ruby -I lib -w bin/sup

Coding standards
----------------

- Don't wrap code unless it really benefits from it. The days of
  80-column displays are long over. But do wrap comments and other
  text at whatever Emacs meta-Q does.
- Use as few parentheses as possible.
- Use {} for one-liner blocks and do/end for multi-line blocks.
