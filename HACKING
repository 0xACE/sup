Running Sup locally
-------------------
Invoke it like this:

ruby -I lib -w bin/sup

You'll have to install all gems mentioned in the Rakefile (look for the line
setting p.extra_deps). If you're on a Debian or Debian-based system (e.g.
Ubuntu), you'll have to make sure you have a complete Ruby installation,
especially libssl-ruby.

Coding standards
----------------

- Don't wrap code unless it really benefits from it. The days of
  80-column displays are long over. But do wrap comments and other
  text at whatever Emacs meta-Q does.
- I like poetry mode.
- Use {} for one-liner blocks and do/end for multi-line blocks.
