Running Sup locally
-------------------
Invoke it like this:

ruby -I lib -w bin/sup

Coding standards
----------------

- Wrap code at 99999 characters. The days of 80-column displays are
  long over. Wrap comments and other text at whatever Emacs meta-Q
  does.
- Use as few parentheses as possible.
- Use {} for one-liner blocks and do/end for multi-line blocks.
- For one-line functions, put a semicolon before "end", like this:
    def bool_writer *args; attr_writer(*args); end
  (I just started doing this for no real reason, and now I kinda like
  it.)
