Sup FAQ
-------
Q: What does Sup stand for?
A: It stands for "what's up?", which is more or less the question in
   mind when I fire up my mail client.

Q: If you love GMail so much, why not just use it?
A: I hate ads, I hate using a mouse, and I hate non-programmability
   and non-extensibility.

Q: Why the console?
A: There are many advantages to the console. A
   few keystrokes can accomplish the work of a hundred mouse clicks
   (as any Unix user knows). Also, you don't need web browser, and you
   get instantaneous response and a simple interface.

Q: How does Sup deal with spam?
A: You can manually mark messages as spam, which prevents them from
   showing up in future searches, but that's all that Sup does. Spam
   filtering should be done by a dedicated tool like SpamAssassin.

Q: How do I delete a message?
A: Press the 'd' key.

Q: But I want to delete it for real, not just add a 'deleted' flag in
   the index. I want it gone from disk!
A: Deleting a message is an old-fashioned concept. In the modern
   world, disk space is cheap enough that you should never have to
   delete a message. If it's spam, save it for future analysis.

Q: C'mon, really now!
A: Ok, at some point I plan to have a batch deletion tool that will
   run through a source and delete all messages that have a 'spam' or
   'deleted' tags (and, for mbox sources, will update the offsets of
   all later messages). But that doesn't exist yet.

Q: I got some error message about needing to run sup-import --rescan
   when I tried to read a message. What's that about?
A: If messages have been moved, deleted, or altered in a source, Sup
   may have to rebuild its index for that source. For example, for
   mbox files, even reading a message changes the offsets of every
   file on disk. Rather than rescanning every time, Sup assumes
   sources don't change except by having new messages added. If that
   assumption is violated, you'll have to run sup-import --rescan.

   The alternative is to rescan every source when Sup starts
   up. Because Sup is designed to work with arbitrarily large mbox
   files, this would not be a good idea.

Q: What are all these "Redwood" references I see in the code?
A: That was Sup's original name. (Think pine, elm. Although I am a
   Mutt user, I couldn't think of a good progression there.) But it was
   taken by another project on RubyForge, and wasn't that original,
   and was too long to type anyways.

   Maybe one day I'll do a huge search-and-replace on the code, but it
   doesn't seem that important at this point.

Q: I want to move messages from one source to another. (E.g., my
   primary inbox is an IMAP server with a quota, and I want to move
   some of those messages to local mbox files.) How do I do that while
   preserving message state?
A: Move the messages from the source to the target using whatever tool
   you'd like. Then (and this is the important part), sup-import
   --rescan both sources at once. If you do it one at a time, you may
   lose message state. (Depending, actually, on which order you do it
   in. But just do them both at once.)

Q: How is Sup possible?
A: Sup is only possible through the hard work of Dave Balmain, the
   author of ferret, which is the search engine behind Sup. Ferret is
   really a first-class piece of software, and it's due to the
   tremendous amount of time and effort he's put in to it.
