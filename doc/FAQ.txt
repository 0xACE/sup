Sup FAQ
-------
Q: What does Sup stand for?
A: "What's up?".

Q: How is Sup even possible?
A: Sup is only possible through the hard work of Dave Balmain, the
   author of ferret.

   I started using Ferret when it was still slightly buggy, and it
   seemed like every week Dave released a bugfix or a speed
   improvement that directly affected sup.  Ferret has become a
   first-class piece of software, and it's almost entirely due to him.
   It amazes me just how much time and effort he has put into it.

Q: Why the console?
A: As the millions (ok, hundreds) of mutt users will tell you, there are
   many advantages to the console:
   - You don't need a bulky web browser.
   - You can ssh and check your mail on another machine.
   - Instantaneous interaction.
   - A few keystrokes are worth a hundred mouse clicks.

Q: If you love GMail so much, why not just use it?
A: I hate using a mouse, and I hate ads, and I hate non-programmability.

Q: How does Sup deal with spam?
A: You can manually mark messages as spam, which prevents them from
   showing up in future searches, but that's all that Sup does. Spam
   filtering should be done by a dedicated tool like SpamAssassin.

Q: What are all these "Redwood" references I see in the code?
A: That was Sup's original name. (Think pine, elm. Although I am a
   Mutt user, I couldn't think of a good progression there.) But it was
   taken by another project on RubyForge, and wasn't that original,
   and was too long to type anyways.

   Maybe one day I'll do a huge search-and-replace on the code, but it
   doesn't seem that important at this point.
