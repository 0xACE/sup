Sup FAQ
-------
Q: What does Sup stand for?

A: It stands for "what's up?", which is more or less the question I'm
   asking when I read my mail.

Q: If you love GMail so much, why not just use it?

A: I hate using a mouse, and I hate ads, and I hate non-programmability
   and non-extensibility.

Q: Why the console?
A: There are many advantages to the console. As any Unix user knows, a
   few keystrokes can accomplish the work of a hundred mouse clicks.
   Also, you don't need web browser, and you get instantaneous response
   and a simple interface.

   That said, a good Ajax programmer could probably replicate GMail
   pretty easily using Sup as the backend.

Q: How does Sup deal with spam?
A: You can manually mark messages as spam, which prevents them from
   showing up in future searches, but that's all that Sup does. Spam
   filtering should be done by a dedicated tool like SpamAssassin.

Q: What are all these "Redwood" references I see in the code?
A: That was Sup's original name. (Think pine, elm. Although I am a
   Mutt user, I couldn't think of a good progression there.) But it was
   taken by another project on RubyForge, and wasn't that original,
   and was too long to type anyways.

   Maybe one day I'll do a huge search-and-replace on the code, but it
   doesn't seem that important at this point.

Q: How is Sup possible?
A: Sup is only possible through the hard work of Dave Balmain, the
   author of ferret, which is the search engine behind Sup. Ferret is
   really a first-class piece of software, and it's due to the
   tremendous amount of time and effort he's put in to it.
