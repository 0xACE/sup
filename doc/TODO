_ use trac or something. this file is getting a little silly.

  we don't catch it until a reload. but we do see a message
  indicating they're loaded to inbox (imap only? hard to reproduce.)
_ bugfix: ferret flakiness: just added message but can't find it.
   possibly a message id tokenization issue.
_ bugfix: read before thread-index has finished loading then hides the
  thread?!? wtf. (on jamie) (? still valid ?)
_ bugfix: display field width in index-mode needs to be determined
   per-character rather than per-byte
_ select all, starred, to me, etc
_ undo

_ configurable colors
_ better batch deletion (extend to non-mbox sources)
_ annotations on messages
_ pop support
_ toggleble wrapping of text
_ maybe: de-archived messages auto-added to inbox
_ prune old entries from people.txt so that it doesn't grow without
   bound
_ maildir+ssh

maybe
-----
_ split out threading & message chunk parsing to a separate library
_ rangefilter on the initial inbox to only consider the most recent 1000 messages
