for 0.0.9

_ add arbitrary labels to sources
_ detect other sup instances and do something intelligent (because ferret crashes violently with more than one index writer open)
_ bugfix: need a way to force an address to a particular name, for things like evite addresses
_ bugfix: read before thread-index has finished loading then hides the thread?!? wtf. (on jamie)
_ bugfix: ferret flakiness: just added message but can't find it.

   catch it until a reload (sometimes?)
_ bugfix: add new message counts until keypress

x bugfix: attachment filenames sometimes not detected (filename=)
x bugfix: rmail multipart error

more control character support in buffer line editing
wide character support

toggle wrapping
maybe: de-archived messages auto-added to inbox
