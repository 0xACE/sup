Just a few simple steps to make a new release.

ditz release <releasename>
ditz changelog <releasename> > tmp.txt
cat History.txt >> tmp.txt
mv tmp.txt History.txt
vi History.txt    # and cleanup
vi ReleaseNotes   # and add whatever's necessary
vi www/index.html  # and bump version number
# ... git add, commit, etc
git checkout -b release-<releasename>
vi lib/sup.rb bin/sup # and bump BOTH version numbers
# ... git add, commit, etc
rake release VERSION=<releasename>
git publish-branch
rake upload_webpage
rake upload_report
git checkout next
git merge master
