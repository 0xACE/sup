title: long message ids (>255 characters) never get matched by ferret
desc: |
  this is a ferret bug.
  Apparently, constructing a TermQuery object with a field value of more than
  255 characters never successfully matches.
  
  This is not a good long-term solution. A good one would be to take the SHA1
  of every message id instead. That will require an index rebuild, so I will
  save that patch until later.
