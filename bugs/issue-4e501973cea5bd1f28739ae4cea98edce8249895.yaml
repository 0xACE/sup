title: thread joining is not preserved when reindexing
desc: |
  the current thread joining just adds references to the index entries. that's
  fine but if the messages are reindexed, the references obviously won't be
  there.
  i think we need to add some separate blob of information somewhere that
  maintains these references, which sup-sync is aware of.
  
  if we're going down the bdb route for state preservation, that might be an
  obvious place to put this too, because it's essentially a hashtable keyed on
  message ids.
