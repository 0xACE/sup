title: flags need a separate backup outside of the ferret index
desc: |
  Ferret still occasionally barfs and corrupts its own index. Currently all
  user state is stored in the index and only in the index, so that means
  you lose big-time if that happens. You can sup-dump your labels, but really,
  how often are you going to do that.
  Sup should maintain a separate backup of all labels in some fast on-disk
  hashtable (message ids to label sets). Bdb comes to mind.
