title: IMAP server restart crashes sup
desc: |-
  this very bizarre backtrace:
  
  --- SystemExit from thread: main
  closed stream
  /usr/lib/ruby/1.8/openssl/buffering.rb:237:in `select'
  ./lib/sup/buffer.rb:31:in `nonblocking_getch'
  bin/sup:227
  
  wtf?
  
  There's no reason that
  nonblocking_getch would be calling the openssl stuff, and openssl's
  buffering.rb doesn't mention select at all. Weird.
