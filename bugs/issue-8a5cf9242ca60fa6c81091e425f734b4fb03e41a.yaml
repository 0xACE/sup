title: index speedup
desc: |
  I've just merged in a changeset that makes Sup store message body
  content in the Ferret index. (They've always been indexed, but now
  they're stored as well.) This means that changing the labels on a
  message can be a copy operation of the previous Ferret document, rather
  than requiring downloading and parsing the original message to create a
  new Ferret document.
  So, this should have two effects:
  
  1. The Ferret index size will expand by about 50%. Sorry.
  2. Tweaking message labels should be much, much faster, since the
  message no longer has to be downloaded from the source in order to
  change the labels. If you've ever tried to label a large IMAP thread,
  you no longer have to wait 5 minutes just to save. :)
  
  The index size increase is unfortunate, but it's something that has to
  happen anyways if we want search-results-mode to have matching text in
  the snippets, which is in the future TODO.
  
  The change was made in such a way that it's incrementally applied
  whenever a message is saved or changed in the Ferret index. So, if you
  want the above behavior on all messages immediately, you must do
  sup-sync --all on a source (which will require downloading each
  message). Otherwise, you will get the slow behavior (message body needs
  to be downloaded from the source) the first time you save a message
  after merging this change, and the fast behavior (no downloading
  required) on all subsequent times.
