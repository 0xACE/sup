		&ldquo;It's just what I wanted, but I hadn't realized what I wanted until I saw it.&rdquo;

		<blockquote>
		&ldquo;Sup is almost to the point where I could jump ship from mutt.&rdquo;

		<blockquote>
		&ldquo;I was previously intrigued by a gmail-styled
		mutt-killer written in Ruby, but having actually spent a few
		hours reading the docs, and trying out all the keys, and
		reading the docs again, and trying the keys out again, and then
		actually engaging in a bunch of practice usage runs, I now
		officially can't fucking wait for the future of this thing; it
		has my full attention.&rdquo;

		&ldquo;Finally a mail client that does what we want, how we want it.&rdquo;

			<p>
   Sup is a console-based email client for people with a lot of email.
   It supports tagging, very fast full-text search, automatic contact-
   list management, custom code insertion via a hook system, and more.
   If you're the type of person who treats email as an extension of your
   long-term memory, Sup is for you.
		</p>

		<p>
		Sup makes it easy to:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
			Handle massive amounts of email.
			</li>

			<li>
			Mix email from different sources: mbox files, IMAP folders,
            and Maildirs, across multiple machines.</li>

			<li>
			Instantaneously search over your entire email collection.
			Search over body text, or use a query language to combine
			search predicates in any way.
			</li>

			<li>
			Handle multiple accounts. Replying to email sent to a
			particular account will use the correct SMTP server, signature,
			and from address.
			</li>

			<li>
			Add custom code to handle certain types of messages or to
			handle certain types of text within messages.
			</li>

			<li>
			Organize email with user-defined labels, automatically track
			recent contacts, and much more!
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
		The goal of Sup is to become the email client of choice for nerds
		everywhere.
		</p>
