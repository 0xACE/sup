<h1>Sup</h1>

<p> Sup is a console-based email client that combines the best
    features of GMail, mutt, and emacs. Sup matches the power of GMail
    with the speed and simplicity of a console interface.
</p>

<p> Sup makes it easy to:

<ul>

<li> Handle massive amounts of email. </li>

<li> Mix email from different sources: mbox files (even across
     different machines), IMAP folders, POP accounts, and GMail
     accounts. </li>

<li> Instantaneously search over your entire email collection. Search
     over body text, or use a query language to combine search
     predicates in any way. </li>

<li> Handle multiple accounts. Replying to email sent to a particular
     account will use the correct SMTP server, signature, and from
     address.

<li> Add custom code to handle certain types of messages or to handle
     certain types of text within messages. </p>

<li> Organize email with user-defined labels, automatically track
     recent contacts, and much more! </li> </ul> </p>

<p> The goal of Sup is to become the email client of choice for nerds
    everywhere. </p>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p> The current version of Sup is 0.0.2, released December 10th, 2006.
    This is an alpha release. It is unix-centric, mbox-specific, and
    has no i18n support. It supports only mbox and IMAP, not POP or
    GMail. I plan to fix all of these problems. </p>

<p> Other than those limitations, it works great! I use it for my
    everyday email, and it makes dealing with 85,000 messages a
    breeze. </p>
