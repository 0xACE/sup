<h1>Sup</h1>

<p>
Sup is an attempt to take the UI innovations of web-based email
readers (ok, really just GMail) and to combine them with the
traditional wholesome goodness of a console-based email client.
</p>
<p>
Sup is designed to work with massive amounts of email, potentially
spread out across different mbox files, IMAP folders, and GMail
accounts, and to pull them all together into a single interface.
</p>
<p>
The goal of Sup is to become the email client of choice for nerds
everywhere.

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>The current version of Sup is 0.0.1, released November 28th, 2006.
This is an alpha release. It is unix-centric, mbox-specific, and has
no i18n support. I plan to fix all of these problems.</p>

<p>Other than those limitations, it works great. I use it for my
everyday email.</p>
