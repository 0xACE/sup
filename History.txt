== 0.0.3 / 2007-01-02

* Major speed increase for index views (inbox, search results), which
  are now loaded completely from the IR index. The only time the
  original sources need to be touched is when viewing a thread. This
  is important for slow sources like IMAP and mbox+ssh.
* Remote mbox support with mbox+ssh URIs.
* IMAP now actually works.
* sup-import uses HighLine and is generally much improved.
* Multitudinous minor bug fixes and improvements.

== 0.0.2 / 2006-12-10

* IMAP support
* Better handling of broken sources. (Everything won't just die.)
* You will need to rebuild both your index, and sources.yaml.
  Sorry!

== 0.0.1 / 2006-11-28

* Initial release. Unix-centrism, support for mbox only, no i18n.
  Untested on anything other than 1.8.5. Other than that, works great!
