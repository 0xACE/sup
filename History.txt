== 0.0.2 / 2006-12-10

* IMAP support

* Better handling of broken sources. (Everything won't just die.)

* You will need to rebuild both your index, and sources.yaml.
  Sorry!

== 0.0.1 / 2006-11-28

* Initial release. Unix-centrism, support for mbox only, no i18n.
  Untested on anything other than 1.8.5. Other than that, works great!
